notes on PoseCamTox development
jerry isdale, starting here 19 August 2025

This folder is a refactoring of the Pose2Art touchDesigner projects of 2023 etc
It is sibling of the new poseCamPC project/git - the app that reads webcam/file
sending osc and ndi skeleton date

Starting with a basic folder structure and scripts/docs generated with help of ChatGPT
(or maybe me helping it)

for reference the osc_trackhands.toe from 2023 is here. It works when poseCamPC is in osc legacy mode.

at this point, the poseCam_Dev.toe is a blank TD project.
first step will be to get it all into git. ... maybe github.
then wire up the scripts per docs/WIRING.md
